	0x16. C -SIMPLE SHELL PROJECT
	The author is IGHALO AUGUSTINE
	
Project was completed using C language Shell Betty linter

General Requirement for project All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 All files ends with a new line

A README.md file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory Used the Betty style to check using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl Shell should not have any memory leaks No more than 5 functions per file All header files should be include guarded Write a README with the description of the project Description hsh is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.

How hsh works Prints a prompt and waits for a command from the user Creates a child process in which the command is checked Checks for built-ins, aliases in the PATH, and local executable programs The child process is replaced by the command, which accepts arguments When the command is done, the program returns to the parent process and prints the prompt The program is ready to receive a new command To exit: press Ctrl-D or enter "exit" (with or without a status) Works also in non interactive mode Compilation gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

Features
Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
Handle errors.
Hndling the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
Hanling the command line with arguments
Handle the PATH
Support the exit features and the exit status
Handle the Ctrl-C to not terminate the shell
Handling the command seperator ;
Handling && and || logical operators
Handle variable replacements $? and $$
Handle the comments #
Support the history feature
Support the file input

Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
Your shell should not have any memory leaks
No more than 5 functions per file
All your header files should be include guarded
Use system calls only when you need to (why?)
Write a README with the description of your project
You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. Format, see Docker

Output
Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)
Example of error with sh:

$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
Same error with your program hsh:

$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$

Compilation
Your shell will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
Testing
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
But also in non-interactive mode:

$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2

$Tasks
0. Betty would be proud
mandatory
Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks
GitHub repository: simple_shell

1. Simple shell 0.1
mandatory
Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

Usage: simple_shell
Your Shell should:

Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
Handle errors.
You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
You don’t have to:

use the PATH
implement built-ins
handle special characters : ", ', `, \, *, &, #
be able to move the cursor
handle commands with arguments
execve will be the core part of your Shell, don’t forget to pass the environ to it…
